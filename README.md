# Database-and-java

This is the program which is concerned about working with database.

At the beginning we can see a frame with three options. We are able to add some user to DB, read its data or even remove and modify. 

During adding a user we must provide a  name or surname. The ID will be added automatically and saved in DB. To do that I used a “java database connectivity” program. 

When it comes to reading and removing, the process is similar to adding. When DB won’t find a user which you are looking for, the information about that will be displayed. 

It terms of modifying, at the beginning we should provide a data which we want to change. After that the information about future steps will appear and we can provide new name and surname.

Each warning, reading and most of other action will be displayed on text area.
